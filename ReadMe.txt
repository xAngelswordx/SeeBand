SeeBand provides robust and efficient functionality for modeling temperature-dependent transport properties based on the parabolic band model. 
It is designed for ease of use and aims to enhance understanding of the relationship between electronic band structure and transport properties. 
In addition to analyzing your data sets, we encourage you to explore its features and experiment with the interactive overlay.

The software is available as source code as well as executable program that can be downloaded and started directly in the respective folders.

If you encounter any issues, have questions, or would like to provide feedback, please feel free to contact me at Michael.parzer@tuwien.ac.at.

Thank you!
